The files there are related to my talk at DEFCON, "From easy wins to epic challenges".

For the actual talk, it is available there : https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20villages/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Bug%20Bounty%20Village%20-%20From%20Easy%20Wins%20to%20Epic%20Challenges%20-%20Bounty%20Hunter%20Edition%20-%20Daniel%20Blaklis%20Le%20Gall.mp4 - but all files there are supporting the talk.

demo-videos folder contains the my demo videos that I use during the talk; the dirty_demo_env folder contains the code (quite dirty) that I used to reproduced all the flaws locally to have solid demo to present. This can still be used to understand the mechanism behind all flaws I'm talking about :)

Hope you'll have a fun time with those!
Blaklis
